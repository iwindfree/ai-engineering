So let you see the creation of the logo here. And yes, so that basically kind of sums up the reason behind the logo and all the meanings behind the symbolism. And as we've kind of seen recently in politics and in the world, there's a lot of situations where water is very important right now and it's a very big issue, so that is the reason that the back of the logo is considered water.

And you'll hear a little bit more about our confluence week is basically highlighting all of these indigenous events and things that are happening around Denver so that we can kind of bring more people together and kind of share this whole idea of Indigenous Peoples Day.

Please rise with the Pledge of Allegiance by Councilman Lopez.

Madam Secretary, do you have any presentations? None, Mr. President. Communications. Do we have any communications? None, Mr. President. We do have one proclamation this evening. Proclamation 1127 in observance of the annual Indigenous Peoples Day in the City and County of Denver. Councilman Lopez, will you please read it? Thank you, Mr. President. Proclamation number 17. Well, let me just say this differently. Proclamation number 1127, series of 2017, in observance of the second annual Indigenous Peoples Day in the City and County of Denver. Whereas the Council of the City and County of Denver recognizes that the Indigenous peoples have lived and flourished on the lands known as the Americas since time immemorial and that Denver and the surrounding communities are built upon the ancestral homelands of numerous Indigenous tribes, which include the Southern Ute, the Ute Mountain, Ute tribes of Colorado. And whereas the tribal homelands and seasonal encampments of the Arapaho and Cheyenne people along the banks of the Cherry Creek and South Platte River confluence gave bearing to the future settlements that would become the birthplace of the Mile High City. And whereas Colorado encompasses the ancestral homelands of 48 tribes and the City and County of Denver and surrounding communities are home to the descendants of approximately 100 tribal nations. And whereas on October 3rd, 2016, the City and County of Denver unanimously passed Council Bill 801, series of 2016, officially designating the second Monday of October of each year as Indigenous Peoples Day in Denver, Colorado. And whereas the Council of the City and County of Denver continues to recognize and value the vast contributions made to the community through Indigenous Peoples knowledge, science, philosophy, arts, and culture. And through these contributions, the City of Denver has developed and thrived. Whereas the Indigenous community, especially youth, have made great efforts this year to draw attention to the contributions of Indigenous people, including Confluence Week, drawing record attendance to a national Indigenous youth leadership conference, leading conversations on inclusion with their peers, and supporting increased Indigenous youth participation in science and engineering. Now therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, section 1, that the Council of the City and County of Denver celebrates and honors the cultural and foundational contributions of Indigenous people to our history, our past, our present, and future, and continues to promote the education of the Denver community about these historical and contemporary contributions of Indigenous people. Section 2, that the City and County of Denver, Colorado, does hereby observe October 9th, 2017, as Indigenous Peoples Day. Section 3, that the Clerk of the City and County of Denver shall attest and affix the seal of the City and County of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to the Denver American Indian Commission, the City and County of Denver School District No. 1, and the Colorado Commission on Indian Affairs. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Your motion to adopt. Mr. President, I move that proclamation number 1127, series of 2017, be adopted. All right, it has been moved and seconded. Council members of Council, Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. It gives me a lot of pleasure and pride to read this proclamation officially for the third time, but as Indigenous Peoples Day in Denver officially for the second time. It is, it's always awesome to be able to see, not just this proclamation come through, come by my desk, but to see so many different people from our community in our, in our council chambers. It was a very beautiful piece of artwork that you presented to us earlier. And it is exactly the spirit that we drafted this proclamation. And this actual, the ordinance that created Indigenous Peoples Day, when we sat down and wrote it, and as a community, we couldn't think of anything else to begin except for the confluence of the two rivers. And those confluence of the two rivers created such a great city. And we live in such an amazing city. And we, we're all proud of it. And sometimes we, and a lot of people from all over the country are proud of, all over the world are proud of it. And sometimes a little too proud of it, just tell them to go back home. But I'm kidding when I say that. But the, the really nice thing about this is that we are celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day out of pride for who we are and who we are as a city and the contributions of Indigenous people to the city. Not out of spite, not out of a replacement of one culture over the other, or, or out of contempt or disrespect. You know, I think of a quote that Cesar Chavez made very, very popular. And it stuck with me for a very long time. And anytime I have the opportunity, I speak in front of children, and especially children in our community that, you know, they often second guess themselves and where they're coming from, who they are. And I always say that, you know, it's, it's very important to be proud of who you're from. And the quote that I use from Cesar Chavez is, you know, pride in one's own cultures does not require contempt or disrespect of another. Right. And that's very important. It's very important for us to recognize that no matter who we are, where we come from in this society, that your pride in your own culture doesn't require, should not require the contempt or disrespect of another. And man, what a year to be, for that to just sit on our shoulders for a while, for us to think about. Right. And so I wanted to just thank you all, to thank the commission. There's going to be a couple individuals that are going to come speak. Thank you for your art, your lovely artwork for us to see what's in your heart and what now has become a, probably is going to be a very important symbol for the community. And also just for the work, the daily work every single day. We still have a lot of brothers and sisters whose ancestors once lived in these lands freely now stand on street corners, right. In poverty. Without access to services, right. Without access to sobriety or even housing or jobs. And what a, what a cruel way to pay back a culture that has paved the way for the city to be built upon its shores. Right. So we have a lot of work to do. And these kinds of proclamations and this day is not a day off. It's a day on in Denver. Right. And, and, and addressing those, those, those critical issues. So I, I know that my colleagues are very supportive. I'm going to ask you to support this proclamation, as I know you always have done in the past. I'm very proud of today. Oh, and we made time magazine and newsweek once again, today as being a leader in terms of the cities that are celebrating indigenous people's day. I\n"
